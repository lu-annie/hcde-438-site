          Overview: 
        </p>
          1. I created a new GitHub page and cloned the GitHub repository and example site
        </p>
          2. I opened the html and css files in HTML
        </p>
          3. I edited index.html first, then the bio.html, and so on
        </p>
          4. Then, I changed the CSS for all pages to be consistent, starting with colors, then images, then fonts
        </p>
          5. Commited changes to GitHub for a working site
          </p>

          Issue:
        </p>
          I wanted to change the fonts on my page so I edited in the body section of the CSS, but it didn't work.
          I realized it needed a semicolon and fixed it by putting a semicolon after the new font and it resolved the error.

          CSS Transition:
        </p>
          I picked the CSS transition that changes the text color when you hover over something because I wanted something simple and subtle that would still be impressive when in action.
          I made this work by putting "h1:hover{
            color: #ff10f0;
          }" in the index.css file.

          Ideas and Future:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add many more cooler CSS transitions (maybe combine transitions)</li>
          <li>Download and use personalized fonts</li>
          <li>Create sub-pages for case studies</li>
          <li>Add back buttons on each page</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
