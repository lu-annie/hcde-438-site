Development Process:
</p>
1. I created a GitHub folder for my extension with a README file
</p>
2. I cloned the GitHub folder and opened it in VS Code
</p>
3. Created a manifest.json file for the Chrome extension
</p>
4. Created Content.js to block specific websites when accessed
</p>
5. Created popup.js and popup.html to create the Pomogranate extension popup with the timers
</p>
6. Added favicon and icons of different sizes
</p>
7. Commited changes to GitHub

Issue Deep-Dive:
</br>
One issue I encountered at the beginning was a logic error in which I was not able to start the timer when I first loaded the extension. Just the HTML showed up, but none of my CSS or JavaScript worked.
</p>
I solved it by looking over other examples of extensions to see how all the JavaScript and CSS files interacted. I realized the HTML file had a line of code at the top:
"link rel="stylesheet" href="./.....css" which linked the HTML to the CSS file. Furthermore, I added a line of code that had "script" on both sides, which would essentially tell the
HTML file to execute the specified JavaScript file. This made me understand that the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files all need to communicate to each other, so I will remember to
put those lines from now on into my code.
</p>
Ideas and Future Work:
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Change fonts of the extension to something beyond a simple Sans Serif</li>
  <li>Create an animated background to use as the site blocker (i.e. a spinning pomegranate animation?)</li>
  <li>Release extension to the Chrome store</li>
</ul>
