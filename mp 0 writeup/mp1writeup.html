Development Process:

1. I created a GitHub folder for my extension with a README file
</p>
2. I cloned the GitHub folder and opened it in VS Code
</p>
3. Created a manifest.json file for the Chrome extension
</p>
4. Created Content.js to block specific websites when accessed
</p>
5. Created popup.js and popup.html to create the Pomogranate extension popup with the timers
</p>
6. Added favicon and icons of different sizes
</p>
7. Commited changes to GitHub

Issue Deep-Dive: Description of an issue you ran into, and the steps you took to resolve it
</br>
One issue I encountered at the beginning was not being able to start the timer when I first loaded the extension.
</p>
Ideas and Future Work:
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Change fonts of the extension to something beyond a simple Sans Serif</li>
  <li>Create an animated background to use as the site blocker (i.e. a spinning pomegranate animation?)</li>
  <li>Release extension to the Chrome store</li>
</ul>
