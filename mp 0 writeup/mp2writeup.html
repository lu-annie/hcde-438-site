  <h2><MP-2>MP-2 Writeup</h2>
  Overview and Usage:
</p>
6 sketches were created using the p5.js editor. The sketches ranged from a static picture to an audio and visual program.

</p>
Sketch #1: Russian Flag
</p>
I drew the Russian Flag using rectangles of different colors. I made sure the rectangles were even by dividing the windowWidth and windowHeight into 3rds.

</p>
Sketch #2: Disco Inferno!
</p>
I drew random circles of varying sizes and in varying shades of red/orange. Every time the page gets refreshed, new circles get generated in a new pattern.

</p>
Sketch #3: Gone Bananas!
</p>
This is an infinite loop of speedy banana-shaped objects. I used the example sine wave function (https://p5js.org/examples/math-sine-wave.html) as a base and changed the speed and shapes to create banana-shaped objects.

</p>
Sketch #4: Art:)pad
</p>
This is an interactive artpad. Press the mouse and drag to draw. Change the color of the pen by clicking the top left button. Use any key on the keyboard to erase.

</p>
Sketch #5: Don't Touch His Nose
</p>
If you move your mouse over Mike Wazowski (Sully's?) nose, a "Bruh" sound effect will play, and the image will change to Ice Age Baby Mike Wazowski.

</p>
Sketch #6: Playing the Case Closed Main Theme
</p>
Click the button to play the main theme to the anime series "Case Closed!" Or click any key to play a note in the song's key.

Development Process:
</p>
Week of Jan 23 - Jan 27
</p>
I drafted out sketches 1, 2, 3, and 4
</p>
I completed each sketch 1 by 1 until all 4 were completed
</p>
I cleaned up the sketches and added finishing touches
</p>
Week of Jan 31 - Feb 5
</p>
I drafted out sketches 5 and 6
</p>
Completed sketch 6, then sketch 7
</p>
Created gallery and hosted sketches on gallery

Issue Deep-Dive:
</br>
One issue I encountered was not being able to host the interactive sketches on my gallery.
</p>
I got it to work at the beginning by running the Liver Server extension. The issue was that I linked my local file as href, so if I clicked the p5 link on my homepage, it'd only take me to a page I could see on my computer (others couldn't access it). I solved it by running the Live Server extension in VS Code, then pushing the changes to GitHub. It took a while, but I knew the interactive sketches were accessible from a proper link when I saw the browser started with [my github username].github.io.
</p>
Ideas and Future Work:
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Create more complex static images</li>
  <li>Create a sketch that moves according to audio (frequency wave?)</li>
  <li>Change the sound of the keys to be more like a piano (or create a piano with functioning keys)</li>
</ul>
