  <h2>Final Project Prototype Writeup</h2>
  Overview and Usage:
</p>
Block Destructor is a game created using p5.js and p5play. This is a prototype version of a soon-to-be more advanced version with greater user customizability.
In this game, blocks come in random directions at random speeds (within a range), and a player has to move to the end without hitting the blocks.
Once they do, they will reach a new level and can keep levelling up until they hit a block.
</p>
How to play:
</p>
1. Click anywhere on the loading screen to start
</p>
2. Use the left, right, and up arrow keys to move the player
</p>
3. Try to reach the top of the screen
</p>
4. Avoid the blocks - hit them and you lose
</p>
5. Try to beat your highest score!

Development Process:
</p>
1. I set up my p5js file with the p5play template
</p>
2. I created the player sprite
</p>
3. I created variables for blocks and added blocks coming from different directions
</p>
4. I added the instructions and game over screens
</p>
5. I called the screens by creating a mousePressed() function
</p>
6. Deployed my game to GitHub
</p>

Issue Deep-Dive:
</br>
One issue I encountered was that the file would not run when I was trying to deploy it to GitHub (showed a blank screen)
</p>
I fixed this by using "Inspect Element" on the page, and realized there was an error in one of the scripts that I didn't need (p5 sound library), so I removed that. 
I also added treeshake: false to my rollup configuration.
</p>
Ideas and Future Work:
</br>
<ul>
  <li>User can customize player</li>
  <li>Make blocks move faster as player levels up</li>
  <li>Add more blocks as player levels up</li>
  <li>Pause and restart buttons</li>
  <li>Allow user to change styling</li>
</ul>
</p>
Project scope: How has your project scope changed now that you have completed your prototype? What features have been added/removed to/from your anticipated final project?
</p>
I want to keep the game at a static screen, but just add levels that increase in difficulty instead, because I wasn't sure how to get the player sprite to start inching toward the bottom
as time passed, and I wasn't sure how to extend my screen as the player moved up. I like this idea better though, as I have the ability to add more components.
</p>
Time management: How did the amount of time you spent building your prototype compare to your initial plan? Were there any unanticipated roadblocks or setbacks?
</p>
The prototype took longer than anticipated and I still need to connect Firebase to a scoreboard as I intended in my project, which I will refine in my final project.
</p>
Implementation plan: How has your implementation plan for your final version changed now that you have completed your prototype? Why has it changed?
</p>
I need to spend more time on the Firebase portion and I also want to focus more on styling and customization. I will make style changes to my game first and foremost, and add a leaderboard, along with
pause and restart buttons so the experience is more game-like.
