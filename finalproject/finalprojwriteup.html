Development Process:
</p>
1. I set up my p5js file with the p5play template
</p>
2. I created the player sprite (which moves horizontally)
</p>
3. I created the falling circles sprites (which add to the score)
</p>
4. I added the loading and game over screens
</p>
5. I called the screens by creating a mousePressed() function
</p>
6. I added music and adjusted that to play when the game started
</p>
7. Deployed my game to GitHub

Issue Deep-Dive:
</br>
One issue I encountered was that the score would not update when the circle was collected by the player.
</p>
I originally used circle.remove() to remove the circles if they overlapped the player. I was under the impression the player would've "collected" the circle, but the score stayed at 0.
I fixed this by removing the circle.remove() line, and replaced it by resetting the y-value and x-value of the circle to generate a new one that falls. Removing the circle would've broken the loop, hence why the score didn't update.
</p>
Ideas and Future Work:
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Allow user to choose a song (and have background change according to song)</li>
  <li>Create Easy, Normal, and Hard modes, as most rhythm games currently have</li>
  <li>Change the pattern for notes to match closely to the beat (the notes fall at a constant pace in this game)</li>
  <li>Allow user to pause the game and resume at a click of a button</li>
</ul>
