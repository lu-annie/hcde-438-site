  <h2>Final Project Writeup</h2>
  Overview and Usage:
</p>
ArtPad2.0 is an online drawing app where a user can draw using their mouse.
Users can select a pen color by clicking the color setting
</p>
How to use:
</p>
Click on the color boxes under "Pen Color" and "BG Color" to select colors for the respective choices.
</p>
Adjust brush size using the slider.
</p>
Draw anything by clicking and dragging across the screen. Undo or clear as needed.
</p>
Download your work and give it a name if you'd like.

Development Process:
</p>
1. I took a different direction from my prototype game, and instead used my artpad project from Assignment 2 as a baseline.
</p>
2. I set up the sidebar and (using Florin Pop's post below) drawing pad.
</p>
3. I added a background color changer
</p>
4. I turned the brush size into a slider
</p>
5. I created the undo button.
</p>
6. I created the download button and added JS to allow for user input for the title of the saved image.
</p>
7. Deployed my app to GitHub using the development toolchain steps
</p>

WIP (this project built off a previous mini artpad I made for my p5 library assignment)

Issue Deep-Dive:
</br>
One issue I encountered was that after deploying my website, the CSS would not show up despite it showing up on npm run start.
</p>
In order to fix this, I had to add "style.css" to my rollup.config.js under the src section, next to "index.html,"
as I think the web could not find my CSS file if I didn't write it into the rollup file.
</p>
Ideas and Future Work:
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Add redo button (in case user accidentally undos something)</li>
  <li>Allow user to change opacity/transparency of brush pen</li>
  <li>Allow user to save work in-app and view (sort of like p5)</li>
  <li>Allow users to add images/draw with images</li>
  <li>Add layers option like in art programs</li>
</ul>
