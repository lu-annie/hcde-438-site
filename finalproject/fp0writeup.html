At least two drawing of your envisioned interface
Descriptions of two versions of your project:
Prototype version - A minimal version that demonstrates the core features of your app. This should be functional, but it does not have to be robust or beautiful. For example, some parts might be hardcoded instead of accepting user input, and you might have minimal CSS styling.
Final Version - Your envisioned final submission.
A numbered, step-by-step plan for your development process, with two milestones (the prototype version and final version)
A list of known unknowns (things you don't currently know how to do, but know you will have to figure out)
A list of stretch goals.
