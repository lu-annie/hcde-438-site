          Description:
        </p>
          My final project is going to be a rendition of the game "Crossy Road" (made with p5.js and p5play) that uses Firebase to store a user's high scores.
        </p>
          Drawings:
        </p>
        1. Prototype
      </p>

        2. Final Version
      </p>

          Prototype Description:
          </p>
          The prototype version will have circles moving across the roads, and a randomly generated avatar for the user to control. It will long the current score and high scores for the time the game window is open.
          The player uses the space bar to move up roads. If the player overlaps with a circle, or they wait too long and hit the bottom of the screen, a game over screen shows up, detailing the user's score and high score, and allows them to restart
          by clicking anywhere on the screen.
        </p>
          Final Version Description:
        </p>
        The final version will start off by letting the user select one out of 6 avatars. Depending on the avatar the user selects, that will be their character which they guide through the game. The graphics of the game will be much more detailed, with the circles being
        replaced by fish moving along the ocean. The green areas will be the rest areas, and are tiny islands where there are no fish. There will also be a high score and current score
        counter in the right lower corner, and in the left lower corner, there are buttons to pause and restart the game (which will lead to the respective screens shown in the drawing).

          Development Process:
          </p>
          1. Brainstorming on paper - sketch design and required features
        </p>
          2. Create moving parts in p5
        </p>
          3. Deploy game to github using dev toolchain
        </p>
          3/7: Prototype Finished
        </p>
          4. Styling edits (colors, images, etc.)
        </p>
          3/9: Demo in class
        </p>
          6. Make final changes between 3/9 and 3/17 (colors, images, functionality)
        </p>
          3/17: Final Version Finished
        </p>
          Unknowns:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Backend database that stores high scores (Firebase)</li>
        <li>Avatar selection for user</li>
        <li>Randomly generated "cars" - fish in this game</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Stretch Goals:
        </p>
        <li>Moving fish in random left/right directions on ocean roads</li>
        <li>Make user move up one road everytime the spacebar is hit</li>
        <li>Home screen and ending/game over screens</li>
        <li>Allow user to restart and pause</li>
        <li>Find solutions for unknowns</li>
